This is a codebook pertaining to the tidy data set submitted with the Getting and Cleaning Data course assignment

It extends the existing codebooks found at:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#
relating to the following data sets:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/
For additional information on the variables, specifically look at the file "features_info.txt"

This codebook describes in brief how the various variables in the final dataset were derived.
Further details can be found in the README.md file and the run_analysis.R script

The data file itself was generated by adding the Subject and Activity columns from the relevant data files:
i.e. X_test.txt, y_test.txt, subject_test.txt 
these were added to the 
X_train.txt, y_train.txt, subject_train.txt files to form a single data set

This file was then reduced to only use the 66 variables that are either means \ standard deviations. The file was then aggregated on subject and activity to create one row per subject \ activity combination. The aggregation method on the variables was mean. THis does not necessarily make sense but is more for academic purposes.

The file was saved in space delimited format

following columns exist:
Subject:
  type:int
  description: A number from 1-30 indicate the subject who partook in the trial
Activity:
  type:chr
  description: a string representing the type of activity that was being performed 
  for the measurement. These were coded from the original dataset as follows:
     1 -> WALKING
     2 -> WALKING_UPSTAIRS
     3 -> WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
     4 -> SITTING
     5 -> STANDING
     6 -> LAYING_DOWN

Variables
The following variables where created by taking the mean of the their values in the original dataset. This mean was grouped by subject and by activity
